# OSI Model Writeup
The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a very important model used in networking that you will reference all the time. There are 7 "Levels" or "Layers" to this model and each layer contains its own set of responsibilities. Down below is the OSI model and a few processes that happen at each of the layers
* Layer 7: Application Layer (the layer you see, Google, Youtube, Twitter, ect)
* Layer 6: Presentation Layer (Encoding and encryption)
* Layer 5: Session Layer (Communication between devices as well as tunneling and control protocols)
* Layer 4: Transport Layer (TCP and UDP)
* Layer 3: Network Layer (Routers, IP, Packets, Layer 3 switches)
* Layer 2: Data Link Layer (Switches, MAC, Frame)
* Layer 1: Physical Layer (Networking Cable, NIC, Hubs)
