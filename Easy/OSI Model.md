# OSI Model Writeup
This writeup is not meant to cover all the data explained in the room, I have added a little bit of info and removed some info, so this might be more of notes than the write-up but whatever

The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a very important model used in networking that you will reference all the time. There are 7 "Levels" or "Layers" to this model and each layer contains its own set of responsibilities. Down below is the OSI model and a few processes that happen at each of the layers

* Layer 7: Application Layer (the layer you see, Google, Youtube, Twitter, ect)
* Layer 6: Presentation Layer (Encoding and encryption)
* Layer 5: Session Layer (Communication between devices as well as tunneling and control protocols)
* Layer 4: Transport Layer (TCP and UDP)
* Layer 3: Network Layer (Routers, IP, Packets, Layer 3 switches)
* Layer 2: Data Link Layer (Switches, MAC, Frame)
* Layer 1: Physical Layer (Networking Cable, NIC, Hubs) 

## Task #1
* What does the "OSI" in OSI Model stand for? **Open Systems Interconnection**
* How many layers (in digits) does the OSI model have? **7**
* What is the key term for when pieces of information get added to data? **eccapsulation**

## Task #2 (Layer 7)
* What is the name of this layer? **Application**
* What is the technical term that is given to the name of the software that users interact with? **Graphical User Interface** (GUI) 

## Task #3 (Layer 6)
* What is the name of this layer? **Presentation**
* What is the main purpose that this layer acts as? **Translator**

## Task #4 (Layer 5)
* What is the name of this layer? **Session**
* What is the technical term for a connection is successfully established? **Session**
* What is the technical term for "small chunks of data"? **Packets**

## Task #5 (Layer 4)
* What is the name of this layer? **Transport**
* What does TCP stand for? **Transmission Control Protocol**
* What does UDP stand for? **User Datagram Protoco**
* What protocol guarantees the accuracy of data? **TCP**
* what protocol doesn't care if data is received or not by the other device? **UDP**
* What protocol would an application such as an email client use? **TCP**
* What protocol would an application that downloads files use? **TCP**
* What protocol would an application that streams video use? **UDP**

## Task #6 (Layer 3)
* What is the name of this layer? **Network**
* Will packets take the most optimale route across a network? **Y** 
* What does the acronym "OSPF" stand for? **Open Shortest Path First**
* What does the acronym "RIP" stand for? **Routing Information Protocol**
* What type of adddresses are dealt with at this layer? **IP Addresses**

## Task #7 (Layer 2)
* What is the name of this layer? **Data Link**
* What is the name of the piece of hardware that all networked devices come with? **Network Interface Card** (NIC)

## Task #8 (Layer 1)
* What is the name of this layer? **Physical**
* What is the name of the numbering system that is both 0's and 1's? **Binary**
* What is the name of the cables that are used to connect devices? **Ethernet Cables** (or fiber is also a thing)

## Task #9 (OSI Game) 
This is the interactive part of the room where you have to retrieve a flag
*  Escape the dungeon to retrieve the flag. What is the flag? **___________**
