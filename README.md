# TryHackMe-WriteUps
I like messing around and learning things with the site TryHackMe and this will be some of my write ups for rooms on there. TryHackMe room have a few levels of difficulty and these write ups will be broken up into folders based on the rooms difficulty. Here on this readme will simply be a chart showing all the rooms I have done write-ups for along with a bit of data about each room.
